                The land covered by the Amman Governorate has been inhabited since the prehistoric age, ruins of
            civilizations as early as 7250 BC have been discovered at 'Ain Ghazal near Amman, the site itself is one of the largest prehistoric settlements in the Middle East.
            Amman was the capital and stronghold of the Ammonites, which they called Rabbath Ammon, the 
            Ammonites ruled almost the entire land of the Capital Governorate. After the Romans took control
            of the region, Amman was renamed as "Philadelphia", and was one of the ten Roman Decapolis 
            cities. Following the Arab Muslim conquests, Philadelphia reclaimed the name Amman. 
            The Byzantine site at Umm ar-Rasas was designated as a World Heritage Site in 2004.
